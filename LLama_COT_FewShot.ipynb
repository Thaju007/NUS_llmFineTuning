In this study, we aimed to assess which thigh muscle groups are preferentially inflamed in DM and PM, respectively, using short-tau inversion-recovery MRI sequences. We analysed 71 patients from 2 Rheumatology centres, 31 with DM and 40 with PM diagnosed according to the Bohan and Peter criteria. MRI oedema (1=present, 0=absent) was assessed bilaterally on fat-suppressed sequences in 17 pelvic floor and thigh muscles. An MRI oedema score (range 0-17) was calculated by adding the separate scores bilaterally and dividing them by two. Inter-rater variability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient. Fisher's exact test was used to compare binomial data. Age and gender ratio were similar in patients with DM and PM. Disease duration (months, mean±SD) was shorter (20±31) in DM than in PM (53±69) (p=0.02). The intraclass correlation coefficient between the radiologists involved was 0.78. Muscle oedema was more common in DM than in PM except in the posterior thigh muscles. In particular, 68% of patients with DM had involvement of at least one anterior thigh muscle versus 38% of patients with PM (p=0.02).\n",

      "Context: Health services often spend more on safety interventions than seems cost-effective. This study investigates whether the public value safety-related health care improvements more highly than the same improvements in contexts where the health care system is not responsible. An online survey was conducted to elicit the relative importance placed on preventing harms caused by 1) health care (hospital-acquired infections, drug administration errors, injuries to health care staff), 2) individuals (personal lifestyle choices, sports-related injuries), and 3) nature (genetic disorders). Direct valuations were obtained from members of the public by using a person trade-off or \"matching\" method. Participants were asked to choose between two preventative interventions of equal cost and equal health benefit per person for the same number of people, but differing in causation. If participants indicated a preference, their strength of preference was measured by using person trade-off. Responses were obtained from 1030 people, reflecting the sociodemographic mix of the UK population. Participants valued interventions preventing hospital-acquired infections (1.31) more highly than genetic disorders (1.0), although drug errors were valued similarly to genetic disorders (1.07), and interventions to prevent injury to health care staff were given less weight than genetic disorders (0.71).

It is a prodrug and is metabolized in the liver to its active metabolite, norcitalopram. The half-life of citalopram is about 20 hours. It is not recommended for use in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. It is a very well tolerated drug with minimal side effects.

      "Context: In a recent study, a new gene, GPR120, was identified as a major determinant of susceptibility to the development of type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to identify the association of the GPR120 gene with type 2 diabetes and its potential role in the development of insulin resistance. The study population included 1,000 type 2 diabetic patients and 1,000 non-diabetic controls. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The frequency of the GPR120 rs1298021 polymorphism was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients than in controls (p<0.001).

Fisher's exact test was used to compare binomial data. Age and gender ratio were similar in patients with DM and PM. Disease duration (months, mean±SD) was shorter (20±31) in DM than in PM (53±69) (p=0.02). The intraclass correlation coefficient between the radiologists involved was 0.78.

      "Context: Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNFα antibody, has been found to increase the risk of serious infections compared with the TNF receptor fusion protein etanercept in some studies. It is unclear whether the risk varies by patient characteristics. We conducted a study to address this question. We identified members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who initiated infliximab (n = 793) or etanercept (n = 2692) in 1997-2007. Using a Cox model, we estimated the propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of serious infections requiring hospitalization or opportunistic infections comparing infliximab initiators to etanercept initiators. We tested whether the adjusted HR differed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and smoking status. The crude incidence rate of serious infections per 100 person-years was 5.4 (95%CI: 3.8, 7.5) in patients<65 years and 16.0 (95%CI: 10.4, 23.4) in patients ≥ 65 years during the first 3 months following treatment initiation. Compared with etanercept, the adjusted HR during this period was elevated for infliximab in patients<65 years (HR: 3.01; 95%CI: 1.49, 6.07), but not in those ≥ 65 years (HR 0.94; 95%CI: 0.41, 2.13).

      "Context: Hereditary transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis with increased left ventricular wall thickness could easily be misdiagnosed by echocardiography as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Our aim was to create a diagnostic tool based on echocardiography and ECG that could optimise identification of ATTR amyloidosis. Data were analysed from 33 patients with biopsy proven ATTR amyloidosis and 30 patients with diagnosed HCM. Conventional features from ECG were acquired as well as two dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, speckle tracking derived strain and tissue characterisation analysis. Classification trees were used to select the most important variables for differentiation between ATTR amyloidosis and HCM. The best classification was obtained using both ECG and echocardiographic features, where a QRS voltage>30 mm was diagnostic for HCM, whereas in patients with QRS voltage<30 mm, an interventricular septal/posterior wall thickness ratio (IVSt/PWt)>1.6 was consistent with HCM and a ratio<1.6 supported the diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis.

      "Answer:What is Peyronie’s disease?  Peyronie’s disease is a disorder in which scar tissue, called a plaque, forms in the penis—the male organ used for urination and sex. The plaque builds up inside the tissues of a thick, elastic membrane called the tunica albuginea. The most common area for the plaque is on the top or bottom of the penis. As the plaque builds up, the penis will curve or bend, which can cause painful erections. Curves in the penis can make sexual intercourse painful, difficult, or impossible. Peyronie’s disease begins with inflammation, or swelling, which can become a hard scar.  The plaque that develops in Peyronie’s disease is not the same plaque that can develop in a person’s arteries. The plaque seen in Peyronie’s disease is benign, or noncancerous, and is not a tumor. Peyronie’s disease is not contagious or caused by any known transmittable disease.\n",

      ".Answer : When the body is in a state of stress, such as during an illness or during physical activity, the body’s response is to conserve energy. The kidneys respond to this by excreting more water, which is a good thing, because it helps to flush out toxins and waste products. But too much water can cause the blood vessels to dilate, which can lead to edema, or swelling. In addition, the body will try to conserve energy by conserving glucose (sugar) in the blood. This is why people with diabetes have high blood sugar levels, which can lead to a number of complications, including nerve damage, eye damage, and kidney damage.\n"

      ".Answer : Vitiligo is a skin condition that causes patches of white skin, called macules. The patches of skin may be flat or raised. The patches may be isolated or occur in groups. The patches may be on the face, arms, legs, or other parts of the body. The condition usually affects people who are between 15 and 30 years old, but anyone can get it. Vitiligo is not contagious. The cause of vitiligo is not known. It is thought that the immune system may attack pigment-producing cells in the skin. Some people with vitiligo have a family history of the condition. Vitiligo is not a sign of poor health or a sign of a serious illness. There is no cure for vitiligo. Treatment can help make the patches of skin less noticeable.\n",

      ".Answer : 1. Tay sachs disease is a genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15. This mutation results in the inability of the body to produce the enzyme HEXA. This enzyme is needed for the proper function of a number of enzymes and proteins. The enzyme is needed for the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids. The lack of this enzyme results in a buildup of fat in the liver, spleen, and other organs. This fat accumulates and causes the liver to enlarge and eventually die. The buildup of fat also causes the brain to swell and eventually die. The death of the brain causes the loss of the ability to control movement, which results in the characteristic symptoms of the disease. The disease is also known as Tay-Sachs disease. 2. There are two types of Tay sachs disease: 1. The infantile form, also called the infantile or infantile-onset form, is the most common form of the disease and is the most severe. This form of the disease is also known as infantile-onset or infantile form. This form of the disease is usually diagnosed in the first year of life. The infantile form of the disease is characterized by the following: 1. The first symptom of the disease is a loss of the ability to control movement. The loss of control of movement results in the characteristic symptoms of the disease, such as the inability to walk or stand. 2. The loss of control of movement results in the characteristic symptoms of the disease, such as the inability to walk or stand. 3.

A multi-component program designed to mobilize support of family networks demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing depressive symptoms in caregivers. However, the impact of an intervention consisting solely of family meetings on depression and anxiety has not yet been evaluated. This study examines the preventive effects of family meetings for primary caregivers of community-dwelling dementia patients. A randomized multicenter trial was conducted among 192 primary caregivers of community dwelling dementia patients. Caregivers did not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive or anxiety disorder at baseline. Participants were randomized to the family meetings intervention (n=96) or usual care (n=96) condition. The intervention consisted of two individual sessions and four family meetings which occurred once every 2 to 3 months for a year. Outcome measures after 12 months were the incidence of a clinical depressive or anxiety disorder and change in depressive and anxiety symptoms (primary outcomes), caregiver burden and quality of life (secondary outcomes). Intention-to-treat as well as per protocol analyses were performed. A substantial number of caregivers (72/192) developed a depressive or anxiety disorder within 12 months. The intervention was not superior to usual care either in reducing the risk of disorder onset (adjusted IRR 0.98; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.38) or in reducing depressive (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient=-1.40; 95% CI -3.91 to 1.10) or anxiety symptoms (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient=-0.55; 95% CI -1.59 to 0.49).

Retrospective cohort study. Three northern California family planning clinics. All women with abnormal Pap smear results referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. Routine clinic protocols for follow-up–telephone call, letter, or certified letter–were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up.

Cross-sectional analysis of the 2006, 2009, and 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). Children ≤18 years of age undergoing tonsillectomy with/without adenoidectomy were included. Risk-adjusted generalized linear models assessed for differences in hospital cost and length of stay (LOS) among children managed by (1) non-children's teaching hospitals (NCTHs), (2) children's teaching hospitals (CTHs), and (3) nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). Risk-adjusted logistic regression compared the odds of major perioperative complications (hemorrhage, respiratory failure, death). Models accounted for clustering of patients within hospitals, were weighted to provide national estimates, and controlled for comorbidities. The 25,685 tonsillectomies recorded in the KID yielded a national estimate of 40,591 inpatient tonsillectomies performed in 2006, 2009, and 2012. The CTHs had significantly higher risk-adjusted total cost and LOS per tonsillectomy compared with NCTHs and NTHs ($9423.34/2.8 days, $6250.78/2.11 days, and $5905.10/2.08 days, respectively; P<.001).

      "Context: To determine the effects of a 3-month intervention on depression in older adults with insomnia. The investigators conducted a randomized, controlled trial of a 3-month intervention to assess the effects of a 3-month intervention on depression in older adults with insomnia. The intervention consisted of 2 sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and a 3-month telephone follow-up. The CBT intervention consisted of a 2-hour session of CBT. The intervention was provided to a sample of older adults in a community setting. The authors used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in a community-based sample of older adults. The BDI is a 21-item scale that assesses the presence of depressive symptoms. The BDI has been used in a variety of community-based studies.\n",
